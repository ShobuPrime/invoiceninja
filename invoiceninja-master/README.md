```
A list of environment variables can be found [here](https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/blob/master/.env.example)


### With docker-compose

A pretty ready to use docker-compose configuration can be found into [`./docker-compose`](https://github.com/invoiceninja/dockerfiles/tree/master/docker-compose).
Rename `.env.example` into `.env` and change the environment's variable as needed.
The file assume that all your persistent data is mounted from `/mnt/user/appdata/invoiceninja/`.
Once started the application should be accessible at http://IPADDRESS:8000/
